When **[Marco Martorana](https://marcomartorana.it/)** asked me to speak at GDG Palermo on a topic of my choice, I had a moment of hesitation. I wanted to choose a subject that was not only interesting for the audience but also something I was truly passionate about. After some reflection, I decided to talk about **Liquid Computing**, a concept I had recently explored in-depth for some articles published on **TheRedCode**.

You can read my articles on this topic here: [Liquid Computing: Optimization and Fluidity for Kubernetes](https://theredcode.it/architetture/intro-liquid-computing/).

Yesterday, as I arrived at GDG Palermo, the energy in the room was palpable. The venue, hosted by BIP, was perfect for fostering discussions and networking. From the very first talks, I realized how high the level of presentations was: current topics, well-prepared speakers, and, most importantly, an engaged and curious audience.

When it was my turn to speak, I was filled with excitement, but my passion for the topic took over. I spoke about the great work done by Prof. **Fulvio Risso** and the **Liqo** team, explaining how Liquid Computing can revolutionize resource management in cloud computing. It was great to see so many people engaged, asking questions, and sharing their thoughts.

One of the things I appreciated the most was the interaction with the audience: the questions and discussions that emerged during and after my talk made the experience even more stimulating. When a topic sparks curiosity and debate, it means it has truly resonated.

Additionally, it was a pleasure to reconnect with many former colleagues, such as **Danilo Trombino**, **Giuseppe Portaluri**, and many others. These moments of exchange not only enrich my professional experience but also make events even more special.

For those who couldn’t attend or want to delve deeper into the topic, I have made the slides from my talk available. You can find them next to this post.

GDG Palermo proved to be an extraordinary event, a perfect opportunity to share knowledge, network, and discuss innovative technologies. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute and can’t wait to participate in future events!

If you have any questions or would like to share your thoughts on the event, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn. I’d be happy to chat.
