[{"categories":null,"contents":" When Marco Martorana asked me to speak at GDG Palermo on a topic of my choice, I had a moment of hesitation. I wanted to choose a subject that was not only interesting for the audience but also something I was truly passionate about. After some reflection, I decided to talk about Liquid Computing, a concept I had recently explored in-depth for some articles published on TheRedCode.\nYou can read my articles on this topic here: Liquid Computing: Optimization and Fluidity for Kubernetes.\nYesterday, as I arrived at GDG Palermo, the energy in the room was palpable. The venue, hosted by BIP, was perfect for fostering discussions and networking. From the very first talks, I realized how high the level of presentations was: current topics, well-prepared speakers, and, most importantly, an engaged and curious audience.\nWhen it was my turn to speak, I was filled with excitement, but my passion for the topic took over. I spoke about the great work done by Prof. Fulvio Risso and the Liqo team, explaining how Liquid Computing can revolutionize resource management in cloud computing. It was great to see so many people engaged, asking questions, and sharing their thoughts.\nOne of the things I appreciated the most was the interaction with the audience: the questions and discussions that emerged during and after my talk made the experience even more stimulating. When a topic sparks curiosity and debate, it means it has truly resonated.\nAdditionally, it was a pleasure to reconnect with many former colleagues, such as Danilo Trombino, Giuseppe Portaluri, and many others. These moments of exchange not only enrich my professional experience but also make events even more special.\nFor those who couldnâ€™t attend or want to delve deeper into the topic, I have made the slides from my talk available. You can find them next to this post.\nGDG Palermo proved to be an extraordinary event, a perfect opportunity to share knowledge, network, and discuss innovative technologies. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute and canâ€™t wait to participate in future events!\nIf you have any questions or would like to share your thoughts on the event, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.

As is typical when approaching conferences of this caliber, the desire to catch up on the latest cutting-edge innovations, engage with international experts, and discover new technological solutions was palpable. There was a strong anticipation to immerse oneself in a stimulating environment, where every presentation could be a key piece in understanding how digital technology is transforming urban infrastructures and beyond.\nBut it wasnâ€™t only the technical program that made this summit unforgettable. Gran Canaria proved to be an extraordinary backdrop, enhancing every single moment of the event. Imagine an island where the volcanic landscape blends with the vastness of the ocean, creating scenes that inspire and rejuvenate the soul. Walking among modern exhibition spaces and enjoying outdoor breaks where the sun and the sea merge with discussions on digital twins and data spaces was a rare and precious privilege.\nThe summit provided a comprehensive overview of the new frontiers in the FIWARE world. I had the opportunity to attend presentations that emphasized how the open source platform is fostering the creation of innovative hubs worldwide and accelerators dedicated to startups and companiesâ€”essential tools for tackling the challenges of digital transformation. The presentations highlighted the potential of FIWARE technologies to optimize infrastructure management, promote sustainability, and facilitate dialogue between the public and private sectors within an international collaborative context.\nA moment of particular significance for me was undoubtedly my presentation; I had the opportunity to present my project on urban resilience to flood risksâ€”a topic that now more than ever demands innovative and timely solutions. During my talk, I explained how the FIWARE platform can be used to monitor river levels in real time, manage critical infrastructure, and improve emergency response strategies. I demonstrated how the integration of sensors and data analytics systems can transform the way cities prepare for and react to crisis situations, contributing to a safer and more resilient urban environment. The ensuing discussion underscored the interest in and need for technological solutions that address real-world problems, a strong indication that digital transformation is entering a new era.\nThus, the experience at the FIWARE Global Summit was much more than merely attending a conferenceâ€”it was an opportunity for personal and professional growth, a journey among innovative ideas, technical insights, and naturally stunning settings. Every moment, from the first introductory session to the last informal chat, was an invitation to think big and push beyond conventional boundaries.\nðŸ“„ Full presentation slides How FIWARE can make a City resilient on Flooding Risks.pptx from Antonino Sirchia ","date":"September 16, 2022","hero":"/images/posts/fiware-flood-resilience.png","permalink":"https://antoninosirchia.it/en/posts/fiware-summit-22/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently, I had the privilege of attending the 8th \u003cstrong\u003eFIWARE Global Summit\u003c/strong\u003e in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, an international event that brought together over 400 participants, 150 speakers, and hundreds of presentations, offering a total immersion in the FIWARE ecosystem and its countless applications in smart cities, agri-food, energy, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the days leading up to the event, expectations were sky-high.

Today, I want to share how my team and I, through our IT skills, contributed to supporting the Italian healthcare system, helping to save lives.\nThe Beginning of a Global Challenge It was February 28, 2020. Returning from a vacation day, I received a call from my boss. He looked at me and, with a serious tone, said:\n\u0026ldquo;Youâ€™ve surely heard about the Covid-19 situation. We have an important opportunityâ€”we need to do something.\u0026rdquo;\nAt that moment, Veneto, one of the hardest-hit regions in Italy, had asked us to develop and implement a biosurveillance platform to monitor and prevent the spread of the virus. The challenge was enormous, but the urgency and importance of the mission were crystal clear.\nA Race Against Time The pandemic was spreading rapidly, and the Veneto region was at the heart of Italyâ€™s emergency. Our mission was clear: create a platform capable of collecting crucial data on infections, outbreaks, tests, and other vital information. There was no time to loseâ€”every day mattered.\nWe worked tirelessly, day and night, with our team of developers and a group of experts, coordinating with the regional healthcare service leaders. Every new feature had to be deployed into production at an astonishing speed, without compromising quality or security. The sacrifice was great, but the reason behind it justified everything: we knew our work could mean the difference between life and death for many people.\nA Tangible Impact The first days were a whirlwind of technical discussions, quick decisions, and implementations that, though improvised, were crucial to facing the challenge. The fatigue and stress were overwhelming, but seeing the tangible results of our work kept us motivated. The platform not only monitored the situation in real time but also enabled faster and more effective decision-making. In those days, every minute saved was critical.\nOne moment I will never forget happened one night in Marchâ€”it was around 11 PM, and exhaustion was starting to take its toll. My eyes struggled to stay focused on the numbers and code, and the figures on the screen never seemed to match up. At that moment, we were dealing with an off-by-one error: an elderly woman from Rovigo mysteriously disappeared from the records during a processing phase.\nI wonâ€™t go into the technical details of the bug we discovered, but what made this moment truly unforgettable was what we found out shortly after: that woman had actually passed away just hours earlier. Her death had somehow affected the calculations in the system in the following hours.\nIt felt like a punch to the stomach. I wonâ€™t hide the fact that some of us had to turn off our webcams, unable to hold back tears. It was an incredibly tough moment, but also an enlightening one. It made us deeply understand how crucial our work was and its real-life impact. That small error, in such a delicate context, made us realize firsthand how every single piece of data could make a difference.\nOur dedication and teamwork kept the systems running and up to date despite mounting pressure. We worked nonstop, often sleeping only a few hours a night, but our goal was clear: to use our IT skills to save lives. In times of crisis, every little action counts, and we knew that our contribution would have a meaningful impact.\nExpanding Our Efforts In April, when the healthcare crisis worsened in Lombardy, one of the most affected regions, we were given a new opportunity. Milan and the entire Lombardy region asked us to implement the same biosurveillance platform we had developed for Veneto. Our enthusiasm and determination never waveredâ€”we continued maintaining and evolving the platform, happy to contribute to protecting public health.\nProud of What We Accomplished Today, months later, I look back with pride on what we achieved. I am proud of my team, of the professionalism we demonstrated, and of the fact that, even in the heart of a global pandemic, we managed to put our skills at the service of the community.\nWe are proud to have played our part, and we will continue working to improve the platform, hoping that this global crisis will soon come to an end. The fight against Covid-19 is not over, but our determination and commitment will never wane.\nStay safe, and never forget that even the smallest gesture can make a difference.\n","date":"September 12, 2020","hero":"/images/posts/it-covid-19.png","permalink":"https://antoninosirchia.it/en/posts/covid-19/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Covid-19 emergency has tested not only healthcare systems but also the responsiveness of technology and people.
