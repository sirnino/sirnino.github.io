But what exactly is generative artificial intelligence and how does it work? Long story short: it is a form of artificial intelligence that is able to create new and original content using machine learning algorithms.</p><p>The generated contents may be really diThis can include creating music, art, design, and even writing. In this post, we will examine how generative artificial intelligence is currently being used, what its potential impacts on jobs and industry are, and discuss the debate surrounding this emerging technology.</p><p>Generative AI is being used in many surprising and creative ways. Here are some examples of how it is currently being used:</p><ul><li><strong>Creating music:</strong> some companies are using generative artificial intelligence to create new music for both personal and commercial use. For example, <a href=https://openai.com/>OpenAI</a> has created an artificial intelligence called <em>Jukebox</em> that is able to create complete songs in various styles such as jazz, pop, and rock.</li><li><strong>Creating art:</strong> generative artificial intelligence is also being used to create new art, both digital and physical. For example, an artificial intelligence called <a href=https://www.joelsimon.net/ganbreeder.html>GANbreeder</a> uses a process called &ldquo;breeding&rdquo; to create new images from an initial seed.</li><li><strong>Creating design:</strong> generative artificial intelligence is also being used to create new designs such as clothing, jewelry, and home design objects. For example, a company called <a href=https://modabrain.com/>ModaBrain</a> uses generative artificial intelligence to create new fashion designs quickly and at low cost.</li><li><strong>Creating writing:</strong> finally, generative artificial intelligence is also being used to create new writing such as newspaper articles and stories. For example, OpenAI has created an artificial intelligence called <a href=https://chat.openai.com/>GPT-3</a> that is able to write newspaper articles and other texts in a coherent and credible manner.</li></ul><p>While generative artificial intelligence can be an extremely powerful and versatile technology, many people have also concerns about the impacts it could have on jobs and industry.</p><p>One of the most common concerns about generative artificial intelligence is that it could <strong>replace human workers</strong> in many fields. For example, if artificial intelligence becomes good at creating music or art, it could put many artists and musicians in a difficult position.
Another common concern is that the such kind of AI could also have an impact on industry and how we produce and consume content. For example, if artificial intelligence becomes good at creating writing, it could change the way we produce and distribute editorial content.</p><p>On the other hand, generative artificial intelligence could also both create new opportunities for workers and lead to changes in business models.
For example, there will be for sure an increasing demand of human abilities in the development and maintenance of artificial intelligence systems: indeed the market will see a more and more increasing offering for artificial intelligence-based services and for new products based on AI.</p><p>As with any technology, generative artificial intelligence has both advantages and disadvantages.
Some of the most relevant pros are:</p><ul><li><strong>Speed:</strong> generative artificial intelligence can create new content very quickly compared to what a human could do.</li><li><strong>Originality:</strong> generative artificial intelligence is able to create completely original content that is not based on existing examples.</li><li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> generative artificial intelligence can help make some activities more efficient such as in creating designs or writing articles.</li></ul><p>On the other hand there are, of course, also some cons:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Replacing workers:</strong> as mentioned above, there is a risk that generative artificial intelligence could replace some human workers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quality of work:</strong> generative artificial intelligence may not be able to create high-quality work like humans can.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ethical issues:</strong> there are also ethical concerns about the use of generative artificial intelligence, such as in relation to intellectual property and responsibility for the work created.</p></li></ul><p>It is important that we continue to discuss and ask questions about how to best use generative artificial intelligence to ensure that its benefits are accessible to all and that concerns about replacing workers and responsibility for the work created are adequately addressed. We will continue to monitor the evolution of generative artificial intelligence and reflect on how it can be used responsibly and sustainably.</p></div><div class=btn-improve-page><a href=https://github.com/sirnino/sirnino.github.io/edit/master/content/posts/generative-ai-the-new-big-thing.md><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>Improve This Page</a></div><hr><div class="row next-prev-navigator"><div class="col-md-12 next-article"><a href=/posts/how-to-write-a-good-commit-message/ class="btn btn-outline-info"><span>Next <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></span><br><span>How to write a good commit message</span></a></div></div><hr></div></div></div></section><section class=toc-section id=toc-section></section></div><footer class="container-fluid text-center align-content-center footer pb-2"><div class="container pt-5"><div class="row text-left"><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Navigation</h5><ul><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#about>About</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#skills>Skills</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#experiences>Experiences</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#projects>Projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Contact Me</h5><ul><li><span>Email:</span> <span>asirchia@gmail.com</span></li></ul></div></div></div><hr><div class=container><div class="row text-left"><div class=col-md-4><a id=theme href=https://github.com/hossainemruz/toha target=#><img src=/assets/images/inverted-logo.png>
