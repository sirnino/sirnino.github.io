It was the february the 28th, 2020.

I came back from a vacation day and my boss called me apart and said me:

> Hey, surely you have heard about the Covid-19 situation.. We have the chance to do something...

Verona, Venice and the entire Veneto region asked us to setup a bio-surveillance platform to monitor and prevent the contagion.

It was scaring and, at the same time, exciting!

I'll never forget the very first days. We briefly discussed about the architecture and the technologies to adopt; but we didn't have the chance to plan everything perfectly because, you know, the pandemic was spreading all around the world: the Veneto region, our customer, was one of the most affected region in Italy.

It was a race against time!

We had to release new functionalities in production daily. The regional health service needed to have as much information as possible about the tests, the contagion status, the hotbeds, etc..

Me, my 3 developer team, my boss, my boss's boss and a 4 people subject matter team worked day and night for weeks... I think that we slept for just 3 hours per night for a while...

A sacrifice (not too big after all), but for a good reason. I like to think that we leveraged our IT skills to save lives. In pandemic time, when people put their own lives in danger to save others' one, any help, even the smallest one, can make a difference.

Unfortunately, the pandemic has been on going since march and the situation hasn't improved much over time. For this reason, in april, a new chance to help came to us: Milan and the entire Lombardy region asked us exactly the same platform we deployed in Veneto.

Now we keep maintaining and evolving these platforms, being proud to help saving lives and hoping this situation will end as soon as possible.

I'm proud of my job, I'm proud of my team, I'm proud to be part of this.

Stay safe!
