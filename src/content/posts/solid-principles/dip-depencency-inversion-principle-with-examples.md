The Interface Segretation is a principle postulated by Robert Martin among the **SOLID** Principles for Object Oriented software development.

**SOLID** is a mnemonic achronym that stands for:

* **S**ingle Responsibiliy (SRP)
* **O**pen closed (OCP)
* **L**iskov Substitution (LSP)
* **I**nterface Segregation (ISP)
* **D**ependency Inversion (DIP)

This 5 principles must guide every software developer in wrinting his code. In this article I'll focus on the last one.

This is an article of the SOLID Principles serie. Checkout the other articles here:

* [Open/Closed (OCP)](/programming/solid/2020/08/13/solid-ocp.html)
* [Liskov Substitution (LSP)](//programming/solid/2020/08/14/solid-lsp.html)
* [Interface Segregation (ISP)](//programming/solid/2020/08/14/solid-isp.html)
