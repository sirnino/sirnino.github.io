# What is a design pattern?

  
Every developer, sooner or later, is faced with frequent problems for which someone else, on the basis of various experiences, has defined a solution universally recognized as "the best one".

A design pattern is an abstraction of the best solution to a frequent problem in software development.

# Why to use a design pattern?

If a developer faces a problem, the best idea he could have is to use a well-known and tested solution, without re-inventing the wheel.

Using a design pattern ensures that side effects won't happen during the development process and, also, that the problem will be solved with the best approach possible.
