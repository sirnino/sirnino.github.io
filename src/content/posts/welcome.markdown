Here we are...


For passion, for study and for work I have been in the IT field for 15 years. I saw so many technologies borning and dying and, although I am only 30 years old (more or less), I have accumulated some experience in different fields.


I started as a freelance developer, making websites (of dubious quality, I admit) for friends and relatives; I continued studying the fundamentals of computer science at the University of Palermo, in Italy; now I work at one of the biggest IT companies in Italy and I learn something new every day.


It's the continuous learning that makes me what I am: a computer engineer. I share this destiny and this passion with many others; I'm sure that **you** are one of these people... And it's with you that I want to share my experience, my discoveries, my passions.
To do so I decided to create a small blog. **This** blog. Here I am thinking of publishing as much regularly as possible about  contents that I consider interesting.


This post is my way to say you **WELCOME!**
Let the adventure begins...
